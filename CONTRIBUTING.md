### Version scheme
[SemVer](https://semver.org/)

### Coding rules
[GNU's Writing C](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Writing-C.html)
but with some exceptions:
- don't put additional spaces before braces or parenthesis,
- keep data type in the same line as a function name,
- place pointers' asterisks stuck on to a type name.

## Merge request
- As the source base and it's develop branch can be found on
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/mattmaniak/fiflo/tree/develop)
It would great to use that platform by You to improve the code.

- Before requesting any change, check that your code matches basic standards
described above and test it using the default Linux tty. Also You can open an
issue instead of a request.

- Note that the maintainer is responsible for merging, tagging and versioning.

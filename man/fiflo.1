.TH fiflo 1 "General Commands Manual"
.SH NAME
fiflo - terminal-based text editor with Common User Access keyboard shortcuts
.SH SYNOPSIS
fiflo [basename/filename/option]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Currently supports only all ASCII printable chars, space and horizontal tab.
It has got dynamically allocated buffer which can hold up to 16 MB - 1 chars.
Implementation considers that newline char is equal to the linefeed. The tab
char needs as many bytes as it's width in the editor: from 2, 4 or 8. Also it
supports the paste option from outside the terminal but it probably depends from
the terminal.

.TP

Blinking window with a default tty. It's caused by the implementation which
renders a full window every time. On modern terminal emulators, the problem does
not occur.
.TP
.B Ctrl^[ or Escape
Next six chars will be ignored.
.TP
.B Left cursor position during the live filename edit.
Don't know why the minimum X for the cursor is 1 in that case.

fiflo - TODOs and ideas:
- all escapes and formatting control chars,
- pre-allocation of a memory, e.g. next 16 lines,
- cut/copy/paste,
- improve vertical scroll - hard or soft with prev/next line preview,
- load only part of a file (nearly-infinite buffer),
- search option,
- CRLF support,
- UTF-8 support,
- moving the cursor without a window redrawing,
- cursor scroll in the live filename edit mode,
- more precise Ctrl^Arrow left (full-word cursor scroll),
- regex,
- check variables casting.

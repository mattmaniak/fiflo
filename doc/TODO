fiflo - TODOs and ideas:
- all escapes and formatting control chars,
- pre-allocation of a memory, e.g. next 16 lines,
- cut/copy/paste,
- improve vertical scroll - hard or soft with prev/next line preview,
- load only part of a file (nearly-infinite buffer),
- search option (binary search?),
- UTF-8 support,
- moving the cursor without a window redrawing,
- cursor scroll in the live filename edit mode,
- more precise Ctrl^Arrow left (full-word cursor scroll),
- regex,
- syntax file rework and highlighting improvement,
- wrong terminal size handling instead of force quit,
- lower line of the upper bar doesn't fill a screen during first frame,
- more variables/constants instead of ad hoc calculations,
- file locking?
- editorconfig support?
- last line duplication on macOS - to fix.
- gcc/clang version check in Makefile.
